My work spans various industries, allowing me to tackle challenges in both the public and private sectors, as well as consumer-focused areas.
         In addition to my technical expertise, I  have hands-on experience working with an agency for YouTube gamers. I extracted datasets from top YouTubers and conducted competitive analysis using client data, which provided valuable insights for improving our clients' performance.

Beyond data analysis, I am a passionate advocate for environmental sustainability, specifically focusing on waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. I‚Äôve had the privilege of speaking to audiences across various organizations, sharing insights on the value of waste management and its critical role in public health and environmental conservation. Leveraging my data analysis skills, I‚Äôve conducted research on the impact of plastic waste on human health, particularly when improperly disposed of and contaminating marine environments.

I am also committed to empowering women and girls to pursue careers in data analysis. My mission is to help others cultivate a research mindset, build rewarding careers, and excel in the tech industry. I‚Äôve contributed to organizations like Evolufyafrica and the Provident Green Club of Lagos, supporting initiatives that align with my values.

As I continue to advance in the tech space, I am now focused on leveraging my real-world experience to take on more complex data-driven challenges.
